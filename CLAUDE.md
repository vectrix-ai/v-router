## Architecture Overview

v-router is a unified LLM interface that provides automatic fallback between different LLM providers. The architecture follows a provider pattern with these key components:

### Core Components

1. **Client** (`src/v_router/client.py`): Main entry point that exposes a messages API similar to provider SDKs.

2. **Router** (`src/v_router/router.py`): Handles request routing, fallback logic, and provider selection. Key features:
   - Maintains provider instances
   - Handles model name mappings via `models.yml`
   - Implements fallback strategies (backup models, cross-provider fallback)

3. **Providers** (`src/v_router/providers/`): Each provider inherits from `BaseProvider` and implements:
   - `create_message()`: Sends requests to the provider's API
   - `name`: Provider identifier
   - Model name validation/mapping

4. **Model Configuration** (`src/v_router/models.yml`): YAML file that maps model names to:
   - Available providers
   - Provider-specific model name mappings (e.g., `claude-3-opus` â†’ `claude-3-opus@20240229` for Vertex)

### Request Flow

1. User creates a `Client` with an `LLM` configuration
2. Client receives messages and passes to `Router`
3. Router attempts primary model/provider
4. On failure, Router tries backup models in priority order
5. If `try_other_providers=True`, Router attempts same model on alternative providers
6. Response returned in unified `Response` format

### Provider Integration

When adding a new provider:
1. Create provider class in `src/v_router/providers/`
2. Inherit from `BaseProvider`
3. Implement `create_message()` and `name` property
4. Add to `PROVIDER_REGISTRY` in `router.py`
5. Update `models.yml` with supported models
